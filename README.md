# covid death rate prediction


Coronavirus (COVID-19) is one of the most serious problems that has caused stopping the wheel of life all over the world. It is widely spread to the extent that hospital places are not available for all patients. Therefore, most hospitals accept patients whose recovery rate is high.

The objective of this proyect is building a predicting model that knowing symptoms, age, sex and comorbidities of the patient, can  tell you if the patient is high risk o low risk, so doctors can give her/him priority which can reduce mortality rate.
